Extra notes for 10/10 Mathematics (Statistics)

GENERAL

ALWAYS USE A BACKUP OF DISC 2 as facts like the high scores are constantly
being written to it. The programs can be installed on a HARD DISK. To do
this, just click on the Install icon (Disc 1) and follow the on-screen
instructions. The discs may only be backed up for your own use on a single
computer. Copying discs for any other reason is tantamount to theft and
could lead to prosecution. Site licences are available for establishments
with more than one computer or with a network.

All high scores and results are saved to disc as you exit from the game.
Ensure that you LEAVE THE GAMES USING THE EXIT OPTION rather than pressing
break to ensure your facts are stored. As the programs write results to the
discs, the discs MUST NOT BE WRITE PROTECTED.

MEMORY

10 out of 10 will run on all Acorn 32-bit computers, but on a 1 Mb machine
you may have to switch the computer off for a few seconds and then turn it
back on.

VGA MONITORS

A utility is included on the disc to allow the package to run on most VGA
monitors. It is called !ModeTrans and is inside the !10/10 application (hold
down shift and double-click on the !10/10 application to see it). A help
file for the utility is inside the !ModeTrans application (hold shift and
double-click).

WORDFIT

Wordfit is loaded by double-clicking on the !10/10Word icon (Disc 1).
Instructions are in the game (select "instructions" from the Menu).

If you want to put your own words into WordFit, use !Edit to alter the file
"Words" that is within the !10/10Word application (double-click on the
!10/10Word icon with Shift held down to access it). The file structure is
simply lines containing:

    number,correct spelling,wrong spelling

The number represents the difficulty (1 to 6).

CERTIFICATE PRINTING

To print a certificate in graphic form you should select the disc option
after you've selected print certificate. You should save it onto hard disc
or a blank formatted disc. You can enter your own filename using the
standard Acorn "Path.filename" structure.

Depending on your system, a default path or filename is given. If the
default ends in a dot it is a path and you should enter a filename before
pressing Return. Note that floppy disc users must leave the default path of
the floppy drive - usually ADFS::0.$. - in front of the chosen filename.

The saved file will have the name of the player as the filename. This can be
loaded into Paint and printed in the usual way. We've found that to print an
A4 certificate on a laser printer the parameters to set when you've chosen
Print are:

     Portrait
     X scale       3:2
     X scale       3:2

  Make sure the centimetre square is highlighted green then:

     Corner X      -3.2   (note the minus)
     Corner Y       4

CHEERS - Using your own questions

The questions for the six grades are in files Text3a to Text3f in the
Game3Info directory, which is in the SixGames directory. If you wish to use
your own graded questions just use those names on a backup of the disc. Note
that as they will become the new questions for the grades, the achievement
chart will be altered as they are answered.

All your own question files should go in the Game3Info directory and should
NOT normally be called Text3a to Text3f. When children use them the result
will not be entered on the achievement chart but high scores will still be
obtained. There is a file of questions called PUZZLES already in the
Game3Info directory. You can try it in Cheers with the USER option and look
at it using !Edit to see how you should create your own files.

When you enter your own questions you MUST ensure that EVERY question and
answer is followed by # and every question has ONE right answer preceded by
!. If you use Edit to create the file, it's a good idea to move the cursor
to the top of the file, press F4 and use COUNT to check that there are four
times as many #s than !s. If the numbers do not match up the game will warn
you as the file loads. The MAXIMUM number of questions in a file is 100.

There are several SPECIAL CHARACTERS you can use in your own Cheers files
for powers and fractions. To use them, create the file in Edit and where you
need a fraction or power, use the code given below. Once you have finished
you need to search and replace several times to change the file to the
correct form (You need one search for each code you are changing). In Edit,
press F4 and click on Magic Characters (it will highlight with a *). Then
search and replace the codes with the values given. Remember to put the
cursor to the top of the file between each search. All the codes will be
replaced with single characters, but as the character set is not defined
correctly THEY WILL LOOK STRANGE. Don't worry, they will appear OK in 10 out
of 10.

Power         Use Code          Replace with

CUSTOMISING THE OTHER GAMES

Unlike Cheers, the other games are NOT DESIGNED to be customised by the
user. With care, however, they can be but you should note that even a minor
change from the EXACT file format may cause the game to fail. For example, a
carriage return after the last question is not needed and, if present, will
prevent the program from detecting the end of the file.

Lines beginning with $ at the start of the files explain the structure
required for each level. These can be removed to save room on the disc once
you have read them.

Only make changes to backup versions of the discs. Changes you make to the
files can cause the games to fail - sometimes the display may be corrupted
because the numbers used are outside the given ranges or you may cause an
error message that appears to have no relation to your alterations.
