Select the colour you wish to use from the palette
below by clicking on it.
 
Fill in the part of the diagram indicated by the
question using a different colour for each part.
On level 1 you may use any colour.
 
Be quick though the colour will change at random
the more difficult the game setting.
 
When painting or selecting a colour from the
palette, paint with the TIP of the brush (this
is at the top of the thin stick on levels 1-3).

At level four and above you use a pull down menu system.
Simply place the pointer on one of the menus above and press
a button. A menu will appear. Keeping the button pressed,
move down until you highlight the item you want, then
release it. Grey items cannot be selected.
 
With these menus you can move around the cards as before and
there is also the added item 'Search'. Simply input the
search word and any matches will be shown speeding up the
finding of the correct answer.
