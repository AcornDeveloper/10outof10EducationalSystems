Extra notes for 10/10 Mathematics (Number)

GENERAL

ALWAYS USE A BACKUP OF THE DISC as facts like the high scores are constantly
being written to it. Alternatively, The programs can be installed on a HARD
DISC. All you need to do is to 'drag' the application to a directory window
on your hard disc. The discs may only be backed up for your own use on a
single computer. Copying discs for any other reason is tantamount to theft
and could lead to prosecution. Site licences are available for
establishments with more than one computer or with a network.

All high scores and results are saved to disc as you exit from the game.
Ensure that you LEAVE THE GAMES USING THE EXIT OPTION rather than pressing
break to ensure your facts are stored.

MEMORY

10 out of 10 will run on all Acorn 32-bit computers, but on a 1 Mb machine
you may have to switch the computer off for a few seconds and then turn it
back on.

VGA MONITORS

A utility is included on the disc to allow the package to run on most VGA
monitors. It is called !ModeTrans and is inside the !10/10 application (hold
down shift and double-click on the !10/10 application to see it). A help
file for the utility is inside the !ModeTrans application (hold shift and
double-click).

CERTIFICATE PRINTING

To print a certificate in graphic form you should select the disc option
after you've selected print certificate. You should save it onto hard disc
or a blank formatted disc. You can enter your own filename using the
standard Acorn "Path.filename" structure.

Depending on your system, a default path or filename is given. If the
default ends in a dot it is a path and you should enter a filename before
pressing Return. Note that floppy disc users must leave the default path of
the floppy drive - usually ADFS::0.$. - in front of the chosen filename.

The saved file will have the name of the player as the filename. This can be
loaded into Paint and printed in the usual way. We've found that to print an
A4 certificate on a laser printer the parameters to set when you've chosen
Print are:

     Portrait
     X scale       3:2
     X scale       3:2

  Make sure the centimetre square is highlighted green then:

     Corner X      -3.2   (note the minus)
     Corner Y       4

BIG BANG

The idea of this game is to play as long as you can until it goes bang.
However, during testing, we discovered that it was possible to cheat by
getting 1 correct (100%) and waiting for the bang. To remove this cheat the
percentage stays fixed to 0 until at least 10 questions have been answered
when the correct percentage will be awarded (calculated from the number
right divided by the number answered as in all other cases)

CHEERS

On Grade 2 of Cheers a tip is that the child should have a Ruler handy to
begin with. That will help him or her to visualise the measurements. On
other grades a calculator may be handy. Note that if a question is answered
wrong you fall back one. Then you fall one more if you landed on a "down"
graphic. However if you answer a question wrong and fall back to an "up"
graphic you won't go up.

The questions for the six grades are in files Q1 to Q6 in the Qfile
directory. If you wish to use your own graded questions just use those names
on a backup of the disc. Note that as they will become the new questions for
the grades, the achievement chart will be altered as they are answered.

All your own question files should go in the Qfile directory and should not
normally be called Q1 to Q6. When children use them the result will not be
entered on the achievement chart but high scores will still be obtained.

When you enter your own questions you MUST ensure that EVERY question and
answer is followed by # and every question has ONE right answer preceded by
!. If you use Edit to create the file, it's a good idea to move the cursor
to the top of the file, press F4 and use COUNT to check that there are four
times as many #s than !s. If the numbers do not match up the game will warn
you as the file loads. The MAXIMUM number of questions in a file is 100.

There are several SPECIAL CHARACTERS you can use in your own Cheers files
for powers and fractions. You can see these in Grades 5 and 6. To use them
yourself, create the file in Edit as described in the Parent/Teacher Guide.
Where you need a fraction or power, use the code given below. Once you have
finished you need to search and replace several times to change the file to
the correct form (You need one search for each code you‘re changing). In
Edit, press F4 and click on Magic Characters (it will highlight with a *).
Then search and replace the codes with the values given. Remember to put the
cursor to the top of the file between each search. All the codes will be
replaced with single characters, but as the character set is not defined
correctly THEY WILL LOOK STRANGE. Don't worry, they will appear OK in 10 out
of 10.
