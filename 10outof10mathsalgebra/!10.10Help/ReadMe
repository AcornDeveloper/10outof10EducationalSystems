Extra notes for 10/10 Mathematics (Algebra)

GENERAL

ALWAYS USE A BACKUP OF DISC 2 as facts like the high scores are constantly
being written to it. The programs can be installed on a HARD DISC.

All high scores and results are saved to disc as you exit from the game.
Ensure that you LEAVE THE GAMES USING THE EXIT OPTION rather than pressing
break to ensure your facts are stored.

Note that with the CURRENT PLAYER set to EMPTY, the achievement record is
never altered and high scores are shown within the game being played but not
saved to disc. If the current player is set to empty and several people
enter their names for a multi-player game the high score tables are also not
saved to disc.

MEMORY

10 out of 10 will run on all Acorn 32-bit computers, but on a 1 Mb machine
you may have to switch the computer off for a few seconds and then turn it
back on.

CERTIFICATE PRINTING

To print a certificate in graphic form you should select the disc option
after you've selected print certificate. You should save it onto a blank,
formatted disc (there isn't room on the 10 out of 10 discs). The saved file
will have the name of the player as the filename. This can be loaded into
Paint and printed in the usual way. We've found that to print an A4
certificate on a laser printer the parameters to set when you've chosen
Print are:

     Portrait
     X scale       3:2
     X scale       3:2

  Make sure the centimetre square is highlighted green then:

     Corner X      -3.2   (note the minus)
     Corner Y       4

RIB TICKLER

The questions for the six grades are in files Q1 to Q6 in the Qfile
directory. If you wish to use your own graded questions just use those names
on a backup of the disc. Note that as they will become the new questions for
the grades, the achievement chart will be altered as they are answered.

All your own question files should go in the Qfile directory and should not
normally be called Q1 to Q6. When children use them the result will not be
entered on the achievement chart but high scores will still be obtained.

When you enter your own questions you MUST ensure that EVERY question and
answer is followed by # and every question has ONE right answer preceded by
!. If you use Edit to create the file, it's a good idea to move the cursor
to the top of the file, press F4 and use COUNT to check that there are four
times as many #s than !s. If the numbers do not match up the game will warn
you as the file loads. The MAXIMUM number of questions in a file is 256.

HOOK IT!

Hook it is not specifically designed for user customisation, but you can
alter or replace the files for Grades 3 to 6. These are in the directory
NOTATION and are called HookIt!3 to HookIt!6.

The file structures are described at the start of each file and care should
be taken to follow this. If one of your questions does not appear the
probable cause is that your correct answer is too long. Any other answers
that are too long will cause blanks on the display.

Any expressions for answers in square brackets are processed to be displayed
as numerator and denominator. Note that they must be written to look correct
on screen - this may not be mathematically correct. Look at the current file
for Grade 6 - the way the system works is quite apparent. The MAXIMUM number
of questions in a file is 256.

SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN YOUR OWN FILES

There are several SPECIAL CHARACTERS you can use in your own Rib Tickler
files for powers and fractions and other symbols. To use them yourself,
create the file in Edit as described in the Parent/Teacher Guide. Where you
need a fraction or power, use the code given below. Once you have finished
you need to search and replace several times to change the file to the
correct form (You need one search for each code you‘re changing). In Edit,
press F4 and click on Magic Characters (it will highlight with a *). Then
search and replace the codes with the values given. Remember to put the
cursor to the top of the file between each search. All the codes will be
replaced with single characters, but as the character set is not defined
correctly THEY WILL LOOK STRANGE. Don't worry, they will appear OK in 10 
out of 10.
