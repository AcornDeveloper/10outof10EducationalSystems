Aim to hit the ball into the hole containing the right answer.
Take aim by moving the mouse left and right so that the line
from your ball is pointing towards the hole where you want it
to land. Press a mouse button to fire.
 
At lower levels you only have to hit the green but at higher
levels the ball must come to rest on it and you must judge the
power of the ball using a meter on the left.

On higher levels watch out for bunkers and ponds.
Bunkers are difficult to get out of (the shortest
way off is easiest) and if a ball falls into the
water it is lost.

On higher difficulty settings the height
to which you can throw your hook is
dependant on the power meter on the left.
The meter moves faster at higher levels.
 
You must also use the ledges on the cliffs
on your way up if you cannot reach the
answer in one throw.
 
If you want to drop down to the ground
then click the right hand mouse button.

The object of the game is to get your man to
the correct answer on one of the islands.
 
To do this simply click with the left hand
mouse button where you want him to go. You
can sometimes click on the correct answer
and he will go straight there.
 
Beware of the sharks, the higher the
difficulty the more of them there are.
 
To stop the man press the right hand
mouse button.
