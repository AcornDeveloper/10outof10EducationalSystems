Because of the differences that exist between monitors there are two levels
of mode substitution offered:

        Level:1  This level produces the best screen aspect ratio but
                 requires a certain flexibility from the monitor hardware.

        Level:2  This level will work on a much wider range of monitors but
                 has a slightly elongated display in modes 9,12 and 15.


Before using ModeTrans with any software you should test which level of mode
substitution you need. To do this follow the following procedure:

        After loading the ModeTrans application click on the 'Test' option
        that you will find in the ModeTrans menu.  The desktop display will
        then change to a substituted mode 12 at level:1 and then, after
        about 5 seconds, it will return to the original mode. If during this
        process the display disappears or becomes corrupted you will need to
        select level:2 by clicking on the 'Level' menu option. A further
        selection of 'Test' will confirm the suitability of level:2  

The Maxmem option in the ModeTrans menu will remove the application from the
icon bar whilst retaining the VGA screen mode. This ensures the maximum
memory space for any software that you wish to use.


The Full version of ModeTrans will enable many games to be played on a VGA
monitor.  It will also provide a VGA desktop that uses only half the memory
of modes 27 or 28, this saving of up to 160K can be invaluable, even on a 2
or 4 Mb machine. ModeTrans is also compatible with multisync monitors.


ModeTrans should be compatible with any game that does not attempt to clear
the computers memory and does not use a specially designed screen mode.
